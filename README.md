# -Atari-Pong-with-Asynchronous-Advantage-Actor-Critic-A3C-
Train an AI agent to master Atari Pong using A3C with LSTM for temporal dependencies and parallel asynchronous training.
ðŸŒŸ Features

A3C Algorithm: Asynchronous training with multiple parallel agents
LSTM Integration: Recurrent neural network for temporal credit assignment
Convolutional Architecture: Deep CNN for visual feature extraction
Multi-Process Training: Efficient parallel environment interaction
Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE): Reduced variance in policy gradients
Gradient Clipping: Prevents exploding gradients with norm clipping
Real-time Visualization: Live loss tracking and state monitoring
Custom Atari Preprocessing: Frame stacking, skipping, and normalization
